# Product-Mangement
Product management involves overseeing a product's development and lifecycle to meet customer and business needs. Responsibilities include market research, defining product strategy, collaborating with development teams, executing go-to-market plans, and continuous improvement. Product managers ensure alignment between the product, customer expectations, and business objectives.
## Product Teardown
A product teardown is a detailed analysis of a product to understand its components, functionality, and design. This process involves disassembling the product to study its construction, materials, and technology, often to gain insights for competitive analysis, cost reduction, or innovation.

## KPI Tree
A KPI (Key Performance Indicator) tree is a hierarchical visualization that breaks down a high-level business objective into smaller, measurable components. It helps organizations align activities with strategic goals by mapping out how individual metrics and performance indicators contribute to overall success.
